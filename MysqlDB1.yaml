  =============
  Mysql Database:
    =============
    Introductions:
      MySQL is an open-source database management software that helps users store, 
      organize, and later retrieve data. 
    Mysql server installations:
    ===========================
    #!/bin/bash
#Author: Etech Consulting staff
echo "welcome to mysql database installation wizard!!"
sudo apt update -y
sudo apt install mysql-server
sudo mysql_secure_installation
sudo mysql
    sudo apt-get install mysql-server -y (to install the mysql server application)
    sudo mysql_secure_installation
    steps to reset the root account password:
    =======================================
    1 mysql --version
    2 sudo systemctl stop mysql.service
    3 sudo systemctl status mysql.service
    4 sudo systemctl set-environment MYSQLD_OPTS="--skip-networking --skip-grant-tables"
    5 sudo systemctl start mysql.service
    6 sudo systemctl status mysql.service
    7 sudo mysql -u root
    8 flush privileges;
    9 USE mysql;
    10 ALTER USER  'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'the-new-password';
    11  quit; or exit <enter>
    12 sudo killall -u mysql
    13  sudo systemctl restart mysql.service
    14 sudo mysql -u root -p (to connect to your mysql database server by mysql binary method)

    How to Create a New User:
    =========================
    step 1: CREATE USER 'newuser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
    NB: Just by creating the new user they do not have permissions to access the Database
    
    step 2: GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON * . * TO 'newuser'@'localhost';
    NB: First * means all databases and the second * means all tables
     
    step 3: FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
    NB: you can also use ctrl + l to clear your mysql shell terminal
        or system clear;
    
    How To Grant Different User Permissions:
    ========================================
ALL PRIVILEGES: as we saw previously, this would allow a MySQL user full access to \
a designated database (or if no database is selected, global access across the system)
CREATE: allows them to create new tables or databases
DROP: allows them to them to delete tables or databases
DELETE: allows them to delete rows from tables
INSERT: allows them to insert rows into tables
SELECT: allows them to use the SELECT command to read through databases
UPDATE: allow them to update table rows
GRANT OPTION: allows them to grant or remove other users’ privileges

To provide a specific user with a permission, you can use this framework:
  GRANT (type_of_permission) ON (database_name.table_name) TO 'username'@'localhost';
  NB: each time you alter a permission, be sure to run the command (flush privileges;)
If you need to revoke a permission, the structure is almost identical to granting it:
  REVOKE (type_of_permission) ON (database_name.table_name) FROM 'username'@'localhost';
You can review a user’s current permissions by running the following:
  SHOW GRANTS FOR 'username'@'localhost';
Just as you can delete databases with DROP, you can use DROP to delete a user altogether:
  DROP USER 'username'@'localhost';
To test out your new user, log out by typing:
  quit;
  and log back in with this command in terminal:
    mysql -u [username] -p

How To Create and Manage Databases in MySQL and MariaDB on a Cloud Server:
  steps:
    To begin, sign into MySQL or MariaDB with the following command
    mysql -u root -p (then enter the user password)

We can now create a database by typing the following command:
    CREATE DATABASE new_database; <enter>
    To avoid errors in the event that the database name we've chosen already exists \ 
    use the following command:
    CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS new_database;
How to View Databases in MySQL and MariaDB:
  commands:
    SHOW DATABASES;
How to Change Databases in MySQL and MariaDB:
  commands:
    SELECT database();
To select a database to use for subsequent operations, use the following command:
    USE new_database;
We can see that the database has been selected by re-issuing the command we ran previously:
    SELECT database();

How to Delete a Database in MySQL and MariaDB:
   command:
    DROP DATABASE new_database;
    DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS new_database; (to avoid errors)

    DATA TYPE:
      - CHAR(size) --> A FIXED length string (can contain letters, numbers, and special characters)
      - VARCHAR(size) --> A VARIABLE length string  can vary from 0 to 65535 
      - BINARY(size) -->  Equal to CHAR(), but stores binary byte strings. The size parameter specifies the column length in bytes. Default is 1
      - TEXT(size)-> Holds a string with a maximum length of 65,535 bytes
      - BOOL -> Zero is considered as false, nonzero values are considered as true
      - INT(size) --> A medium integer. Signed range is from -2147483648 to 2147483647
      - FLOAT(p)--> A floating point number. The total number of digits is specified in size
      - DATE --> A date. Format YYYY-MM-DD
      - DATETIME(fsp)->A date and time combination. Format YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss.
      - TIME(fsp)--> A time. Format hh:mm:ss.
      - YEAR -->  A year in four-digit format. Values allowed in four-digit format 1901 to 2155, and 0000.
                  MySQL 8.0 does not support year in two-digit format.

The MySQL CREATE TABLE Statement:
  syntax:
    CREATE TABLE table_name (
    column1 datatype,
    column2 datatype,
    column3 datatype,
   ....
);
example:
CREATE TABLE Persons (
    PersonID int,
    LastName varchar(255),
    FirstName varchar(255),
    Address varchar(255),
    City varchar(255)
);

DROP TABLE table_name; --> use to delete a table

MySQL ALTER TABLE Statement:
  syntax:
    ALTER TABLE table_name
ADD column_name datatype;

example:
  ALTER TABLE Persons
ADD Email varchar(255);
 
 ALTER TABLE table_name
DROP COLUMN column_name;

MySQL PRIMARY KEY Constraint:
  defination of primary key --> The PRIMARY KEY constraint uniquely identifies each record in a table.

  syntax: 
  CREATE TABLE Persons (
    ID int NOT NULL,
    LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    FirstName varchar(255),
    Age int,
    PRIMARY KEY (ID)
);

Constraint:
  CREATE TABLE Persons (
    ID int NOT NULL,
    LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    FirstName varchar(255),
    Age int,
    CONSTRAINT PK_Person PRIMARY KEY (ID,LastName)
);
ALTER TABLE Persons
DROP PRIMARY KEY;
TRUNCATE TABLE table_name;

SHOW COLUMNS FROM table_name
INSERT INTO Persons (FirstName,LastName) VALUES ('Lars','Monsen');
insert into Etechemployee (id,name,position,contact) values ('2023','Elvis','Technical Director','347-873-5512');
DELETE FROM (TABLE) WHERE ID=X;
alter table Etechemployee MODIFY WHERE Age=25;
SELECT * FROM table_name; --> to see the content of the table
UPDATE Etechemployee SET Email = 'engineer@etcehconsultllc.com' WHERE employeeNumber = 1056; -->
use to update information from the table for a particular entry

SELECT firstname, lastname, email FROM employees WHERE employeeNumber = 1056;--> use to select
a specific entry from the table
